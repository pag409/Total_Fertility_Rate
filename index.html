	<h2> Why are people having fewer children?</h2>
	<p> The <a href=https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/123> Total Fertility Rate<a/> is the metric that demographers use to measure the average number of children that a woman is expected to have in her lifetime. For a population to remain stable, the TFR needs to stay at 2.1. In the USA, the TFR has been <a href=https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/vs/2022sum.pdf> below 2.1<a/> since 2009. In New York City, the TFR is even lower. Dr. Frank Heiland, Associate Director of the CUNY Institute for Demographic Research says that the TFR of urban areas are generally lower than the national average. “New York City has definitely been affected more so by rising housing costs than other parts of the country, which is consistent with the idea that in New York City, it's gotten even more difficult to have larger families, or maybe any families at all.” There is no singular reason why people are having fewer children, but it’s not hard to imagine that the <a href=https://www.npr.org/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5540077/housing-prices-fewer-children> rising costs of living</a> might impact that decision for many couples. </p>
